---

## ‚úÖ State Persistence Checklist

### localStorage Test
- [ ] Login to the application
- [ ] Open Browser DevTools (F12)
- [ ] Go to Application tab ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí http://localhost:5173
- [ ] See `auth-storage` key with user data
- [ ] Refresh page (F5)
- [ ] Still logged in ‚úÖ (state persisted)

### Manual State Manipulation (Security Test)
- [ ] In Application tab ‚Üí Local Storage
- [ ] Edit the user email or ID
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] See the changed data displayed
- [ ] **Important**: This shows client-side auth is insecure! ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

## ‚úÖ Backend Security Vulnerability Checks

### Test 1: No Authentication Required
- [ ] Logout from frontend
- [ ] In terminal, run:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users
  ```
- [ ] Still get all users data! ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] This demonstrates: **Backend has no authentication**

### Test 2: Access Any Profile
- [ ] Can access any user's profile with just their ID:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile/1
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile/2
  ```
- [ ] Works without any credentials! ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] This demonstrates: **No authorization checks**

### Test 3: Plaintext Passwords
- [ ] In backend terminal, run: `npm run prisma:studio`
- [ ] Opens Prisma Studio in browser
- [ ] Click on "User" table
- [ ] See all passwords in **plain text**! ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] This demonstrates: **Passwords not hashed**

## ‚úÖ Common Issues & Solutions

### Backend won't start
**Issue**: `Error: Cannot find module`
- [ ] Solution: Run `npm install` in backend directory

**Issue**: `Port 3000 already in use`
- [ ] Solution: Kill the process or change PORT in .env

**Issue**: `PrismaClientInitializationError`
- [ ] Solution: Run `npx prisma generate`

### Frontend won't start
**Issue**: `ECONNREFUSED localhost:3000`
- [ ] Solution: Make sure backend is running first

**Issue**: `Cannot find module 'zustand'`
- [ ] Solution: Run `npm install zustand react-router-dom`

**Issue**: Blank page or React errors
- [ ] Solution: Check browser console (F12) for errors
- [ ] Clear cache and reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Database issues
**Issue**: "Table does not exist"
- [ ] Solution: Run `npm run prisma:migrate`

**Issue**: Want to reset database
- [ ] Solution: Delete `prisma/dev.db` and run migrations again
