# Security Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the security testing tools to identify and understand vulnerabilities in the Phase 1 application.

---

## üêç Python Script (`security_test.py`)

The Python script provides an automated security assessment of your application.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** installed
2. **Backend running** on `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Requests library** installed

### Installation

```bash
# Install required Python package
pip install requests
```

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Make script executable (Linux/Mac)
chmod +x security_test.py

# Run the script
python security_test.py
```

### What It Tests

The script performs 8 comprehensive security tests:

#### Test 1: API Connectivity ‚úÖ

- Verifies the backend is running
- Tests health endpoint
- Validates 404 handling

#### Test 2: Registration Testing ‚úÖ

- Valid user registration
- Duplicate email prevention
- Missing field validation

#### Test 3: Authentication Testing

- Valid login flow
- Invalid password rejection
- Non-existent user handling
- **Identifies: No session token/JWT issued**

#### Test 4: No Authentication (CRITICAL) üö®

- Attempts to access protected endpoints without auth
- **Discovers: All endpoints are publicly accessible**
- **Impact: Complete data breach possible**

#### Test 5: IDOR Vulnerability üö®

- Tests Insecure Direct Object References
- Attempts to access multiple user profiles by ID
- **Discovers: Can enumerate and access all users**

#### Test 6: SQL Injection Testing ‚úÖ

- Tests common SQL injection payloads
- **Confirms: Prisma ORM provides protection**

#### Test 7: Rate Limiting üö®

- Tests for brute force protection
- Sends rapid login attempts
- **Discovers: No rate limiting implemented**
- **Impact: Brute force attacks possible**

#### Test 8: Password Security üö®

- Analyzes password storage
- **Discovers: Passwords stored in plaintext**
- **Impact: All credentials exposed if DB compromised**

## üìì Jupyter Notebook (`security_testing.ipynb`)

The Jupyter notebook provides an interactive learning experience.

### Prerequisites

1. **Jupyter installed**: `pip install jupyter notebook`
2. **Required packages**: `pip install requests pandas colorama`
3. **Backend running** on `http://localhost:3000`

### Starting Jupyter

```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Open security_testing.ipynb in your browser
```

### Interactive Features

The notebook includes:

- **Color-coded output** for easy understanding
- **Detailed explanations** for each vulnerability
- **Code examples** you can modify and re-run
- **Student exercises** to practice security testing
- **Discussion questions** to verify understanding
- **Data visualization** with pandas DataFrames

### Student Exercises

The notebook includes hands-on exercises:

1. **Exercise 1: Brute Force Attack Simulation**

   - Implement a password guessing attack
   - Measure success rate and time

2. **Exercise 2: Data Exfiltration**

   - Extract all user data
   - Save to CSV file
   - Understand data breach impact

3. **Exercise 3: Custom Vulnerability Test**
   - Design your own security test
   - Find vulnerabilities not covered
   - Document your findings

## üéØ Understanding the Results

### Color Coding

- üü¢ **GREEN (PASS)**: Security feature working correctly
- üî¥ **RED (FAIL)**: Critical vulnerability found
- üü° **YELLOW (WARN/INFO)**: Minor issue or informational

### What FAIL Means

A **FAIL** status indicates a security vulnerability:

- For authentication tests: **FAIL is bad** (security broken)
- For injection tests: **PASS is good** (attack blocked)

Example:

```
‚ùå FAIL: Unauthenticated Profile Access
  ‚îî‚îÄ üö® CRITICAL: Accessed profile without auth!
```

This means the security check **failed** - the profile was accessed without authentication, which is a **vulnerability**.

---

## üö® Vulnerabilities Discovered

### Critical Severity

#### 1. No Authentication

**Description**: Protected endpoints accessible without credentials

**Test**:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users
# Returns all users without any authentication!
```

**Impact**: Complete data breach, any attacker can access all data

**Phase 2 Fix**: Implement JWT tokens and authentication middleware

---

#### 2. Plaintext Passwords

**Description**: Passwords stored without hashing

**Verification**:

1. Open Prisma Studio: `cd backend && npm run prisma:studio`
2. Click on User table
3. See passwords in plain text!

**Impact**: All credentials exposed if database is compromised

**Phase 2 Fix**: Use bcrypt to hash passwords

---

#### 3. No Authorization

**Description**: No role-based access control

**Test**: User A can access User B's data

**Impact**: Privacy violations, data theft

**Phase 2 Fix**: Implement authorization middleware

---

### High Severity

#### 4. IDOR Vulnerability

**Description**: Direct object references without access control

**Test**:

```bash
# Access any user profile by changing the ID
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile/1
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile/2
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile/3
```

**Impact**: Enumerate and access all user profiles

**Phase 2 Fix**: Validate user ownership before returning data

---

#### 5. No Rate Limiting

**Description**: Unlimited requests allowed

**Attack Scenario**:

```python
# Attacker can try unlimited passwords
for password in password_list:
    try_login(email, password)
```

**Impact**: Brute force attacks, account takeover

**Phase 2 Fix**: Implement express-rate-limit

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Running

**Error**:

```
Error: Cannot connect to http://localhost:3000/api/auth/health
Make sure the backend server is running!
```

**Solution**:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Missing Python Packages

**Error**:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```

**Solution**:

```bash
pip install requests pandas colorama
