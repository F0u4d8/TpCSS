## 📊 Sample Output

```
======================================================================

  └─ Passwords stored without hashing

[CRITICAL] No Authorization
  └─ No RBAC - any user can access any data

[HIGH] IDOR Vulnerability
  └─ Direct object references without access control

[HIGH] No Rate Limiting
  └─ Unlimited requests allowed - brute force possible
```

## 🎯 What Students Will Discover

### Critical Vulnerabilities (Must Fix in Phase 2)

1. **No Authentication** 🚨
   - Anyone can access "protected" endpoints
   - No JWT tokens or session management
   - Complete data breach possible

2. **Plaintext Passwords** 🚨
   - Passwords visible in database
   - All credentials exposed if DB compromised
   - Verifiable in Prisma Studio

3. **No Authorization** 🚨
   - No role-based access control
   - Any user can access any user's data
   - Privacy violations

4. **IDOR Vulnerability** 🚨
   - Can enumerate all users by changing ID
   - Access any profile without permission

5. **No Rate Limiting** 🚨
   - Unlimited login attempts
   - Brute force attacks possible
   - Account takeover risk

### What's Protected ✅

1. **SQL Injection**
   - Prisma ORM provides protection
   - Parameterized queries used
   - Common payloads fail safely

2. **Input Validation**
   - Required fields checked
   - Duplicate emails prevented
   - Basic validation works

---

## 🎓 For Students

### Learning Flow

1. **Build the app** (Phase 1 instructions)
2. **Run security_test.py** to see what's broken
3. **Open Prisma Studio** to view plaintext passwords
4. **Try manual attacks** with curl
5. **Complete Jupyter exercises** for hands-on practice
6. **Plan fixes** for Phase 2

### Hands-On Exercises

The Jupyter notebook includes:

**Exercise 1: Brute Force Attack**
- Implement password guessing
- Measure success rate
- Understand rate limiting importance

**Exercise 2: Data Exfiltration**
- Extract all user data
- Save to CSV file
- See what attackers could steal

**Exercise 3: Find Your Own Vulnerability**
- Design custom security tests
- Discover new issues
- Document findings

---

## 🎯 For Instructors

### Classroom Demo (30 min)

```bash
# 1. Run the security scanner
python security_test.py

# 2. Show plaintext passwords
cd backend
npm run prisma:studio
# Navigate to User table

# 3. Demonstrate IDOR attack
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile/1
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile/2
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/profile/3

# 4. Show no authentication needed
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/users
# Returns all users without any credentials!
```

### Discussion Points

1. **Which vulnerability is most critical? Why?**
   - Authentication? Authorization? Passwords?
   - How would you prioritize fixes?

2. **What is the difference between authentication and authorization?**
   - Authentication = Who are you?
   - Authorization = What can you do?

3. **Why is client-side protection insufficient?**
   - Frontend can be bypassed
   - Backend must validate everything

4. **How does Prisma prevent SQL injection?**
   - Parameterized queries
   - Type safety

### Assessment Ideas

**Lab Report**: Students write a security assessment documenting:
- All vulnerabilities found
- Severity ratings
- Proof of concept attacks
- Recommended fixes
- Phase 2 implementation plan

**Presentation**: Students demonstrate:
- One critical vulnerability
- How they discovered it
- Real-world impact
- Proposed solution

## 🛠️ Customization

### Change Target URL

Edit `security_test.py`:

```python
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:YOUR_PORT"
```

### Add Custom Tests

Add to `security_test.py`:

```python
def test_my_vulnerability():
    """Test X: Custom Security Test"""
    print(f"\n{Colors.OKCYAN}=== Test X: My Test ==={Colors.ENDC}\n")
    
    # Your test code here
    response = make_request("GET", "/my-endpoint")
    
    if response and response.status_code == 200:
        log_test("My Test", "FAIL", "Vulnerability found!")
    else:
        log_test("My Test", "PASS", "Protected")
```

Then add to `main()`:

```python
def main():
    # ... existing tests ...
    test_my_vulnerability()  # Add your test
    print_summary()
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Ethical Use Only

These tools are for **educational purposes** only:

✅ **Allowed**:
- Testing your own Phase 1 application
- Educational lab environment
- Learning security concepts

❌ **Never Allowed**:
- Testing systems you don't own
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Malicious use

### Why This Approach?

**Learning by Doing**: Students learn better by:
1. Building an insecure application
2. Actively exploiting vulnerabilities
3. Understanding real-world impact
4. Implementing proper fixes

This is **much more effective** than just reading about vulnerabilities!

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Students should be able to:

- ✅ Run security tests successfully
- ✅ Identify all critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ Explain each vulnerability's impact
- ✅ Demonstrate attacks with curl/Python
- ✅ View plaintext passwords in database
- ✅ Understand why each issue is dangerous
- ✅ Propose Phase 2 fixes

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to API"

**Problem**: Backend not running

**Solution**:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'"

**Problem**: Python packages not installed

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Permission denied"

**Problem**: Script not executable (Linux/Mac)

**Solution**:
```bash
chmod +x security_test.py
```

### Colors not showing (Windows)

**Problem**: Windows terminal color support

**Solution**: Use Windows Terminal or install colorama:
```bash
pip install colorama
```
