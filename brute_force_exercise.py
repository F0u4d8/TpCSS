Student Exercise: Implement a Brute Force Attack

‚ö†Ô∏è EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY
Complete the TODOs to create a working brute force attack demonstration.

Learning Objectives:
1. Understand how brute force attacks work
2. Learn why rate limiting is critical
3. Practice Python programming with HTTP requests
4. Understand attack patterns and defense strategies

API_URL = "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login"

    TODO 1: Implement the login attempt function
    
    Instructions:
    - Make a POST request to API_URL
    - Send JSON with email and password
    - Return True if status code is 200, False otherwise
    
    Hints:
    - Use requests.post()
    - Set json parameter

    Instructions:
    - Loop through each password in password_list
    - Try to login with each password
    - Print the attempt number and password being tried
    - If login succeeds, print success message and return the password
    - If all attempts fail, return None
    
    Hints:
    - Use enumerate() to get index and password
    - Call attempt_login() for each password

    Instructions:
    - Record the start time before the attack
    - Run the brute force attack
    - Record the end time after the attack
    - Calculate and print:
      * Total time taken
      * Number of attempts
      * Attempts per second
    
    Hints:
    - Use time.time() to get current time
    - Calculate elapsed time: end_time - start_time
    - Calculate rate: attempts / elapsed_time

# Bonus Challenges (Optional):
# 
# CHALLENGE 1: Add a delay between attempts
# - Add a parameter 'delay' to brute_force_attack()
# - Use time.sleep(delay) between attempts
# - Compare speed with and without delay
#
# CHALLENGE 2: Save results to a file
# - Create a function to save attempt results to CSV
# - Include: attempt number, password, success/fail, time taken
# - Use Python's csv module
#
# CHALLENGE 3: Detect rate limiting
# - Check if response status code is 429
# - If detected, print a message and stop the attack
# - Explain why this is a good security measure
#
# CHALLENGE 4: Try a larger password list
# - Create a file with 100 common passwords
# - Load passwords from the file
# - Compare time taken vs the small list

# DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
# 
# 1. How long did it take to try all passwords?
# 2. How many attempts per second can you make?
# 3. How long would it take to try 1 million passwords?
# 4. Why is this attack successful in Phase 1?
# 5. How would rate limiting prevent this attack?
# 6. What other defenses could stop brute force attacks?
# 7. Is this attack practical in the real world? Why or why not?
